Greetings to the world! 

My name is **Lecheng Ruan**, and I am a **teacher**, an **engineer** and a **researcher** regarding robotics and human-machine intelligence. My technical background spans mechatronics, control, optimization, signal processing, perception and decision making. I currently co-supervise the center of perception and decision in the Laboratory of Human-Machine Hybrid Intelligence, College of Engineering, Peking University, China, and lead the PKU-BIGAI joint team on hybrid intelligence. I am also serving (or served) as the partner of certain venture capitals/business incubators regarding tech startups, and the chief scientist/consultant of a few tech firms, of which the fields are associated with smart manufacturing, health care, medical equipment, and automation.

I obtained my *Ph.D.* degree in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** in 2020, with a major focus on the analysis, control, and optimization of dynamics systems, a well-developed yet interesting implementation of applied mathematics. Thanks to my advisor **Prof. Tsu-Chin Tsao**, I am adequately fortunate to be able to work on various fantastic robotic platforms, including the magnetic bearing and precisioning systems of machine tools, unmanned aerial vehicles and surgical robots. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate student in **Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)**, where I study mechatronics and robotics in the State Key Lab of Robotics and Systems. I have co-authored over 20 peer-reviewed scientific papers, including ***Science Robotics*** and ***IEEE Transactions on Robotics***. I also hold over 15 patents and participate in the setting of over 5 national/international standards.
