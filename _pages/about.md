Greetings to the world! 

My name is **Lecheng Ruan**, and I am a teacher, an engineer and a researcher regarding robotics and human-machine intelligence. My technical background spans mechatronics, control, optimization, signal processing, perception and decision making. I currently co-supervise the center of perception and decision in the laboratory of human-machine hybrid intelligence, College of Engineering, Peking University, China, and lead the PKU-BIGAI joint team on hybrid intelligence. I am also serving (or served) as the partner of certain venture capitals/business incubators regarding tech startups, and the chief scientist/consultant of a few tech firms, of which the fields are associated with smart manufacturing, health care, medical equipment, and automation.

I obtained my *Ph.D.* degree in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles in 2020, with a major focus on the analysis, control, and optimization of dynamics systems, a well-developed yet still interesting implementation of applied mathematics.
