Greetings to the world! 

My name is Lecheng Ruan, and many of my friends, collogues and students also call me LeLe (乐乐). I am a **teacher**, an **engineer**, a **researcher** and an **investor** regarding robotics and human-machine intelligence. My technical background spans mechatronics, control, optimization, signal processing, perception and decision making. I am currently co-supervising the Center of Perception and Decision in the Laboratory of Human-Machine Hybrid Intelligence, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China, and also leading the PKU-BIGAI Joint Group on Hybrid Intelligence, Beijing, China. I serve (or served) as the partner of several venture capitals/business incubators, and also the chief scientist/consultant of a few tech firms, of which the businesses are usually associated with smart manufacturing, health care, medical equipment, and automation.

I obtained my *Ph.D.* degree in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** in 2020, with a major focus on the analysis, control, and optimization of dynamics systems, a well-developed yet interesting implementation of applied mathematics. Thanks to my advisor [Prof. Tsu-Chin Tsao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wADiNucAAAAJ&hl=en), I am adequately fortunate to be able to work on various fantastic robotic platforms, including the magnetic bearing and precisioning systems of machine tools, unmanned aerial vehicles and surgical robots. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate student in **Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)**, where I study mechatronics and robotics in the State Key Lab of Robotics and Systems. I have co-authored over 20 peer-reviewed scientific papers, including [*Science Robotics*](https://www.science.org/journal/scirobotics) and [*IEEE Transactions on Robotics*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8860). I also hold over 15 patents and participate in the setting of over 5 national/international standards.

My team and I firmly believe that creating an intelligent agent to fully mimic or replace the functionalities of human being is ***NEITHER NECESSARY NOR IMPORTANT***. The endpoint of the AI story, in our perspective, should be a hybrid system (or world) of human and artificial agents, where the advantages of both are further promoted as system features, and the shortcomings are compensated in between. The hybrid system should be human-centered, and the ultimate goal should be to carry forward the merits and push forward the physical boundary of human, with the help of algorithmic and embodied intelligent agents. Our research at the current stages, includes the depiction and understanding of environment, the prediction and comprehension of human motion and intension, and the hybrid control for human-machine collaboration. Our lab also has a strong foundation on the design, manufacturing, and implementation of robotic platforms. 

Our team consistently looks for highly-motivated *Postdocs* and also candidates for *M.S.* and *Ph.D.* study, with interests in robotics, perception and decision making. Undergraduate/graduate research assistants with clear related skillsets are also welcomed. Feel free to contact me for collaboration proposals, no matter as a potential student or an independent researcher!

May we all enjoy the fantasy of this world!
